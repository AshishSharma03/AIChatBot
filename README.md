# Basic JavaScript ChatBot

A simple chatbot implemented in JavaScript using the brain.js library.

## Description

This project showcases a basic chatbot implemented in JavaScript. The chatbot is designed to generate responses based on user input and is powered by the brain.js library, which provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and training neural networks.

## Features

- Generates responses to user input using brain.js.
- Trained on a set of predefined messages and corresponding responses.
- Provides an example of a simple conversational agent using neural networks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo


3. Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install

### Usage

   * Run the chatbot:
    node chatbot.js

   * Input a message and observe the chatbot's response.
   * Experiment with different messages and observe how the chatbot generates responses based on the brain.js library.

### Customization
  *  Modify the trainingData array in chatbot.js to train the chatbot with different input-output pairs.
  *  Experiment with different training data and responses to enhance the chatbot's interaction.
